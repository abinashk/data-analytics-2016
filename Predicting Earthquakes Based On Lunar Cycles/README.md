# Predicting Earthquake occurrance based on Lunar Illumination given a Date
This is part of my term project done for Data Analytics Course in RPI.
The basic idea of this project is to correlate Earthquake events with Lunar Cycle(represented by percent of illumation of moon's face for a particular day at noon.) and build a predicting model to determine whether or not an earthquake will occur in a particular day. The analysis is limited to Northern California region. And earthquake dataset was downloaded from IRIS [http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/event/docs/1/builder/] and the Lunar Illumination dataset was downloaded from NASA's web service [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/aa_moonill2.pl?form=1&year=2014&task=00&tz=+00]. This folder contains two data files, R code for the whole analysis and a report.
